- Detect Hebrew text and fall back on other font.
    - Go through each letter of each string and look it up
        in the font. Choose fallback font (Times?). Make cache
        of result, including fallback font.
    - Or maybe do all this in the parsing stage, inserting tags
        or whatever to change font.
- In table of contents handle long chapter names (wrap earlier).
- Why are some lines too long? Grep for paragraph ending
    with "FISH IN A BARREL". Is it the capitals? Look also
    at paragraph starting "AR-ASH-KON-CHEL-NA-VAN-TSIS". It
    must not want to break at hyphen on next line.
- Some em-dashes are being inserted by accident. See where he
    uses multiple hyphens.
- Remove space before two-part punctuation.
- Looks like em dashes are actual em dashes with spaces around them.
    Replace with three hyphens without spaces.
- Make sure ellipses look good. What did we do for Klat book?
- Fix blockquotes at top of chapters.
- Fix embedded blockquotes (signs, etc.).
- Fix date/location at top of chapters.
- Deal with content warning.
- Make high-res version of tree_of_life2.png image, and figure out
    why it's not centered properly. Too small? Also fix all other
    images.
- Make sure there are no straight quotes, or they'll be turned
    into French guimets.
- Insert various photos and drawings.
- Come up with a cover page.
- The repeated "Chapter" in the TOC is unpleasant. What do other
    book like Harry Potter do?
- See what max size of Lulu book is. Maybe split book.
    - Max is 740.
    - Book 1: 1-239 (238)
    - Book 2: 239-579 (340)
    - Book 3: 579-849 (270)
    - Book 4: 849-927 (78)
    - Books 1 and 2: 578
    - Books 3 and 4: 348

- Letter spacing looks weird. Are we loading the font correctly?
    - Seems okay when I zoom in.
