- Handle Hebrew:
    - At line level, reverse Hebrew text.
        - Can't do it at paragraph level, stuff would move up.
    - Define "Hebrew text" as any contiguous sequence of Hebrew
        letter, punctuation, and digits, including at least one
        Hebrew character. Exclude punctuation at the ends.
    - Have fallback Hebrew typeface. Use same size and attributes
        as surrounding text.
    - Regexp for finding Hebrew text: [\u0590-\u05fe]
    - http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf
    - Hebrew text:
        - Every interlude (single character), one has two separated characters.
        - Quote at start of chapter 9 (three words).

- Handle or delete <u> and </u>. Look for other HTML.
- In table of contents handle long chapter names (wrap earlier).
- Why are some lines too long?
- Remove space before two-part punctuation.
- Fix blockquotes at top of chapters.
- Fix embedded blockquotes (signs, etc.).
- Fix all blockquotes.
- Deal with content warning.
- Make high-res version of tree_of_life2.png image, and figure out
    why it's not centered properly. Too small? Also fix all other
    images.
- Make sure there are no straight quotes, or they'll be turned
    into French guimets.
- Insert various photos and drawings.
- Come up with a cover page.
- The repeated "Chapter" in the TOC is unpleasant. What do other
    book like Harry Potter do?
- Add an index?
    - Link to first mention of each character and concept.
    - How to split across two books?
- See what max size of Lulu book is. Maybe split book.
    - Max is 740.
    - Book 1: 1-239 (238)
    - Book 2: 239-579 (340)
    - Book 3: 579-849 (270)
    - Book 4: 849-927 (78)
    - Books 1 and 2: 578
    - Books 3 and 4: 348

- Letter spacing looks weird. Are we loading the font correctly?
    - Seems okay when I zoom in.
