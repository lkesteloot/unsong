- Why are some lines too long?
    - See end of test.md, and see what the penalties are for the various options.
    - Are penalizing too much for being shorter?
    - Is there any way to insert spaces between letters?
        - Or around hyphens.
        - Or in the paragraph indent?
    - Because it looks really ugly to stick out.
- Convert Uriel's text to smallcaps.
    - Write script to find Uriel's lines, count how many there are.
    - If too many, modify script to update them.
    - Also maybe Names of God in chapter 1.
    - Or crowd-source this.
- Types of blockquotes:
    - Resolve isInBlockQuote() and BLOCK_QUOTE block type.
    - Cases:
        - Top of chapters.
            - Typically some text, followed by a reference.
            - Interlude ז has two of them "Let’s play Twister, let’s play Risk"
        - "H has become a most troublesome letter"
            - Could use poetry.
        - A bunch of blockquotes got converted to [blockquote] when they
            should use the old-style three-space-and-double-quote.
        - File contents: "AARON SMITH-TELLER IS BEING HELD"
        - Children's song "A little goat, a little goat"
            - Could use poetry.
        - Sign: "AS PER THE CALIFORNIA SECURITY"
        - Poetry: "O thou, who burns with tears"
        - Poetry: "Ah Love! could thou and I with"
        - "The north and the south Thou hast" (two more after that)
        - Song: "My country, ’tis of thee,"
        - Song: "The careful text-books measure"
    - Need:
        - Explicit line break?
            - Or just regular poetry mode?
    - Use blockquote tag at top of chapters.
    - Fix embedded blockquotes (signs, etc.).
    - Fix all blockquotes.
- Table of Contents:
    - Get rid of the "Book" indent?
    - We'd want it for the third physical book.
    - Maybe display it differently, like a section header.
- Look for HTML.
    - Mostly in block quotes.
- Deal with content warning.
- Make high-res version of tree_of_life2.png image, and figure out
    why it's not centered properly. Too small? Also fix all other
    images.
- Insert various photos and drawings.
- Come up with a cover image.

Done:

- Handle Hebrew:
    - Regexp for finding Hebrew text: [\u0590-\u05fe]
    - http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf
    - Hebrew text:
        - Every interlude (single character), one has two separated characters.
        - Quote at start of chapter 9 (three words).
            - http://unsongbook.com/chapter-9-with-art-celestial/
- The repeated "Chapter" in the TOC is unpleasant. What do other
    book like Harry Potter do?
    - Options:
        - Skip "Chapter 5: ". Will look the nicest but maybe people refer to chapter
            numbers. Also Interludes might be weird.
        - Just show "5: ". Will look weird.
- Add usage message to main().
- Document how to run typesetter on this.
    - Maybe provide script for doing so.
    - Get runtime classpath from gradle, and run it manually?
- Add subtitle.
- Split into three MD files.
- Explicit blockquote section.
    - Indent on both sides.
    - Smaller font.
    - Blank above and below.
- See what max size of Lulu book is. Maybe split book.
    - Max is 740.
    - Book 1: 1-239 (238)
    - Book 2: 239-579 (340)
    - Book 3: 579-849 (270)
    - Book 4: 849-927 (78)
    - Books 1 and 2: 578
    - Books 3 and 4: 348
    - Most balanced option would be three books (1; 2; 3&4).
    - Index in each book? Will need which book. See Julia Child books.
- Correct spelling of "Wiliam".
- Regenerate javadoc.
- In table of contents handle long chapter names (wrap earlier).
    - "And Ololon Said", book 3.
