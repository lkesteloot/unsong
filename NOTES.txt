- In table of contents handle long chapter names (wrap earlier).
- Why are some lines too long?
- Fix blockquotes at top of chapters.
- Fix embedded blockquotes (signs, etc.).
- Fix all blockquotes.
- Look for other HTML.
- Deal with content warning.
- Make high-res version of tree_of_life2.png image, and figure out
    why it's not centered properly. Too small? Also fix all other
    images.
- Make sure there are no straight quotes, or they'll be turned
    into French guimets.
- Insert various photos and drawings.
- Come up with a cover image.
- Add an index?
    - Link to first mention of each character and concept.
    - How to split across two books?
- See what max size of Lulu book is. Maybe split book.
    - Max is 740.
    - Book 1: 1-239 (238)
    - Book 2: 239-579 (340)
    - Book 3: 579-849 (270)
    - Book 4: 849-927 (78)
    - Books 1 and 2: 578
    - Books 3 and 4: 348
    - Most balanced option would be three books (1; 2; 3&4).
- Regenerate javadoc.


Done:

- Handle Hebrew:
    - Regexp for finding Hebrew text: [\u0590-\u05fe]
    - http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf
    - Hebrew text:
        - Every interlude (single character), one has two separated characters.
        - Quote at start of chapter 9 (three words).
            - http://unsongbook.com/chapter-9-with-art-celestial/
- The repeated "Chapter" in the TOC is unpleasant. What do other
    book like Harry Potter do?
    - Options:
        - Skip "Chapter 5: ". Will look the nicest but maybe people refer to chapter
            numbers. Also Interludes might be weird.
        - Just show "5: ". Will look weird.
