- Detect Hebrew text and fall back on other font.
- Deal with brackets in text.
    - Add backslash-escape.
    - Remove space in "[ !" that I added earlier.
- Maybe parse <i> directly as alternative to underscore.
- See what max size of Lulu book is. Maybe split book.
- In table of contents handle long chapter names (wrap earlier).
- Why are some lines too long? Grep for paragraph ending
    with "FISH IN A BARREL". Is it the capitals?
- Get an English hyphenation dictionary, if we don't have
    one already. Make sure it works with all-caps words.
- Some em-dashes are being inserted by accident. See where he
    uses multiple hyphens.
- Remove space before two-part punctuation.
- Looks like em dashes are actual em dashes with spaces around them.
    Replace with three hyphens without spaces.
- Make sure ellipses look good. What did we do for Klat book?
