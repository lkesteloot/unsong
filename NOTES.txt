- Next:
    - Read the book and take notes.
        - I'm supposed to read through chapter 7, but I've removed all the
            chapter numbers. With so many chapters, people might refer to
            chapter numbers. But they're ugly in the Table of Contents.
            I think novels typically don't number chapters?
            - Check novels in our library.
            - Those that have chapter numbers do two things:
                - In ToC, the number lone is outdented to the left.
                - At chapter, the chapter number (with or without "Chapter")
                    is above the chapter name.
            - Dunno how to deal with interludes.
                - Maybe just have only the Hebrew?
                - I think the word "Interlude" is important.
            - How about:
                - In TOC just have number or Hebrew letter.
                - At chapter, have "Chapter 5" or "Interlude א".
            - Need:
                - A syntax to specify both noun and letter.
                - Associate with section.
                - Draw only letter in TOC (modern).
                - Draw both at chapter.
                - Draw neither in page header.
        - Superscript (footnote) numbers seem a little high.
        - Hel-l-bound is hyphenated between the Ls.
            - A bunch of weird hyphenation throughout. Check that we're using the right language.
    - Support drop caps?
    - Skim book 1 and find deal-breakers.
        - HTML.
        - Bad images.
    - Get Aryeh to make a cover.
    - Print book.
- Why are some lines too long?
    - See end of test.md, and see what the penalties are for the various options.
    - Are penalizing too much for being shorter?
    - Is there any way to insert spaces between letters?
        - Or around hyphens.
        - Or in the paragraph indent?
    - Because it looks really ugly to stick out.
- Convert Uriel's text to smallcaps.
    - Write script to find Uriel's lines, count how many there are.
        % python3 count_uriel.py unsong-1.md | wc -l
        179
        % python3 count_uriel.py unsong-2.md | wc -l
        182
        % python3 count_uriel.py unsong-3.md | wc -l
        252
    - If too many, modify script to update them.
        - It's about 613.
        - Modify script to:
            - Go through file.
            - Skip lines that have XXX
            - Show line and line number.
            - Show proposed fix.
                - If there are quotes, only do what's inside quotes.
                - If there are no quotes and the whole line is caps, do whole line.
                - Otherwise look for sequences of upper case?
                - Surround with [sc][/sc].
                - Convert to lower case.
                - Use upper case at start and after period and for "I".
            - Can accept, skip, mark, or quit.
            - If mark, inserts both and puts XXX next to old line.
            - Save as you go, so can be interrupted anytime.
        - Or:
            * Modify script to generate vim errorfile.
                filename:line:column: message
            * Write macros to insert [sc] or [/sc] and convert to lower case.
            * Just do it by hand.
            * If we only want to print the first part, that's only 180 lines.
    * Also maybe Names of God in chapter 1.
        * Test this.
        * Yeah it's much better.
- Types of blockquotes:
    - Resolve isInBlockQuote() and BLOCK_QUOTE block type.
    - Cases:
        - Top of chapters.
            - Typically some text, followed by a reference.
            - Interlude ז has two of them "Let’s play Twister, let’s play Risk"
        - "H has become a most troublesome letter"
            - Could use poetry.
        - A bunch of blockquotes got converted to [blockquote] when they
            should use the old-style three-space-and-double-quote.
        - File contents: "AARON SMITH-TELLER IS BEING HELD"
        - Children's song "A little goat, a little goat"
            - Could use poetry.
        - Sign: "AS PER THE CALIFORNIA SECURITY"
        - Poetry: "O thou, who burns with tears"
        - Poetry: "Ah Love! could thou and I with"
        - "The north and the south Thou hast" (two more after that)
        - Song: "My country, ’tis of thee,"
        - Song: "The careful text-books measure"
    - Need:
        - Explicit line break?
            - Or just regular poetry mode?
    - Use blockquote tag at top of chapters.
    - Fix embedded blockquotes (signs, etc.).
    - Fix all blockquotes.
- Look for HTML.
    - Mostly in block quotes.
- Make high-res version of tree_of_life2.png image, and figure out
    why it's not centered properly. Too small? Also fix all other
    images.
- Insert various photos and drawings.
    - Can we just drop all these? I don't find that they add a lot and
        they make the book look less professional, and they'd be a ton
        of work.
- Come up with a cover image.
    - For 250 pages:
        - 12.873in x 9.25in
        - At 300 DPI, that's 3862 x 2775 pixels
        - Spine: 0.623in / 15.82mm, or 187 pixels, located at 1931, 1387.5 (center) or 1838,0
    - Ask Aryeh.

Done:

- Handle Hebrew:
    - Regexp for finding Hebrew text: [\u0590-\u05fe]
    - http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf
    - Hebrew text:
        - Every interlude (single character), one has two separated characters.
        - Quote at start of chapter 9 (three words).
            - http://unsongbook.com/chapter-9-with-art-celestial/
- The repeated "Chapter" in the TOC is unpleasant. What do other
    book like Harry Potter do?
    - Options:
        - Skip "Chapter 5: ". Will look the nicest but maybe people refer to chapter
            numbers. Also Interludes might be weird.
        - Just show "5: ". Will look weird.
- Add usage message to main().
- Document how to run typesetter on this.
    - Maybe provide script for doing so.
    - Get runtime classpath from gradle, and run it manually?
- Add subtitle.
- Split into three MD files.
- Explicit blockquote section.
    - Indent on both sides.
    - Smaller font.
    - Blank above and below.
- See what max size of Lulu book is. Maybe split book.
    - Max is 740.
    - Book 1: 1-239 (238)
    - Book 2: 239-579 (340)
    - Book 3: 579-849 (270)
    - Book 4: 849-927 (78)
    - Books 1 and 2: 578
    - Books 3 and 4: 348
    - Most balanced option would be three books (1; 2; 3&4).
    - Index in each book? Will need which book. See Julia Child books.
- Correct spelling of "Wiliam".
- Regenerate javadoc.
- In table of contents handle long chapter names (wrap earlier).
    - "And Ololon Said", book 3.
- Fix long chapter names in page headers.
    - See chapter called "That The Children...", start of book 2.
    - "And Ololon Said", book 3.
- Deal with content warning.
X Table of Contents:
    - (Didn't address this, I think it's fine.)
    - Get rid of the "Book" (part) indent?
    - We'd want it for the third physical book.
    - Maybe display it differently, like a section header.
